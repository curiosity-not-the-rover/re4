# re4
oh no


## faq that nobody asked for

### why is the code bad
im bad at code

### why is this a thing
i saw this:  
https://www.reddit.com/r/Vocaloid/comments/hg86sd/i_found_out_the_vocaloid_api_is_bundled_with/  
and  
this:  
https://vocaverse.network/threads/i-found-a-way-to-make-a-legal-custom-vocaloid-editor.4156/  

and i wanted in.

also i saw some videos of people in games changing their voice to miku and i thought "hey wait a second. they dont have to use these ai-voice-changer-thingamajigs. they could just use vocaloid."

### how
smashing rocks together and seeing what works.

more accurately, ghidra, imhex and api monitor. sprinkle a little windbg and it's a perfect ice cream soup.

### its not done
no but this is the most thats been done ever that i can find. i am tired of smashing my head against a brick wall just to be told  
"DiD yOu mEaN: "OpenVAS"  
It LoOkS lIkE tHeRe ArEn'T mAnY gReAt MaTcHeS fOr YoUr SeArCh"  
and then the only result is a reddit thread about someone who can't install miku  
(that is not what we are doing here)

### why dont u get a job
im trying

### why re4
because the version 4 and the resident evil name is funny and you know re can also stand for reverse engineering so it's super funny

### it doesnt make any noise
no i havent figured that out yet i'm not great at this

### what have you seen
i stared into the abyss and it stared back

### it wont compile
have you tried giving it libraries  
if it still doesnt work i might have broken it

### what are you planning to do with this
this is a multi phase project
first is basically getting the api to function like a basic text-to-speech engine. then i want to make a close-to-live voice changer by getting phonemes from mic input and re-creating them in vocaloid. that is a long way off tho. do not get your hype up for that one.

### are you just going on a tangent here
yes

### i can fix the code
great make a pr pls
