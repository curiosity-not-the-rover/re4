Initialize
Should return zero if no errors are found.
Pass L"Ð‚{(KEY-INFORMATION-HERE)}" for successful initialization. Run any program that uses the Vocaloid4 API from API monitor. Then go to API monitor -> first stack in params -> "LPWSTR" value.
alternativey you can find this key info in your registry. go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\VocaloidApi4 and the folder in there will have the name of the key thingo you gotta pass to it.

On a successful startup, OpenVS4's Initialize function will call a number of other functions from the other VocaloidApi4 DLLs. It can take a few seconds to load even in a minimal program.

After Initialize is complete, call "CreateOpenVS". In a proper plugin it then seems to run in the background to handle synthesis by calling other DLLs. I have not been able to replicate this behaviour but I am trying my damn best.


va_DSE4.dll
"DSESetDBMPath" is used to locate the Vocaloid's DBM file.
"DSEDoStepSynthesis" seems to be responsible for the actual voice synthesis.
