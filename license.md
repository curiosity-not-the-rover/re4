# The "did you forget to mention something" license


This software can be distributed by any means and in any format, provided that a copy of the complete text of this license is included with the software. The text can be translated or altered as long as a copy of the original English text is also included. Text in square brackets is exempt from this requirement and can be changed freely.

This software is a good-faith effort to enable access to a proprietary API which some users may own. The API contains no license information of its own. The license(s) of other third-party software which uses the API makes no mention of limitations regarding the API's usage.
The API has a name, primary or otherwise, which suggests third-parties are or were intended to be able to freely interface with it [In this case, OpenVocaloid].

"Proprietary Components" or "proprietary components" refers to third-party proprietary source code, libraries, executables, or other assets.
This software may not function correctly without proprietary components. This software does not grant any licenses to any proprietary components. Users must install any proprietary components separately from this software. All usage of proprietary components in this software is in accordance with the proprietary components' licenses, and/or is reasonable to consider fair use. While every effort is made to allow maximum freedom, some use cases, such as commercial use, of proprietary components via this software may not be considered fair use and may be prohibited.

This software may have flaws. Please review the source code before deciding to run it. No guarantee is made regarding the functionality of this software.
